        <h2> Hello, my name is Matthew Hoefer</h2>
        <div className="life-story">
          <p>I was born in Seattle, Washington on December 30th, 1989. I am very
                interested in
                videogames and comic books growing up and loved to draw. After graduating from Roosevelt high school
                I had a variety of odd jobs, ranging from furiture delivery to legal assistant. Eventually I grew
                bored of the office life and moved to Ningbo, China to teach english. After three years and one pandemic
                I returned to America and embarked on a teaching career. Feeling unsatisfied in the work I then
                became a web developer a pursuit which I enjoys very much even if its frustrating at times.</p>
